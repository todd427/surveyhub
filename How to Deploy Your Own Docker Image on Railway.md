**Yes, you can!**
Railway lets you deploy your own Docker image for a Django (or any) project. This gives you **full control** over your dependencies, build steps, and static files‚Äîvery useful for Django.

# üöÄ **How to Deploy Your Own Docker Image on Railway**

### **1. Create a `Dockerfile` at your project root**

A good starter Dockerfile for Django+Postgres+WhiteNoise:

```dockerfile
# Use official Python image
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Set environment vars
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Set work directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy project files
COPY . .

# Collect static files
RUN python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

# Set environment variables (these can be overwritten by Railway)
ENV DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=surveyhub.settings.prod

# Expose port (usually 8000)
EXPOSE 8000

# Start the server with Gunicorn for production
CMD ["gunicorn", "surveyhub.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

* Replace `surveyhub` with your actual Django project name if different.
* Make sure `requirements.txt` includes `gunicorn`, `psycopg2-binary`, `whitenoise`, `dj-database-url`.

---

### **2. Add a `requirements.txt`**

Include at least:

```
Django>=5
gunicorn
whitenoise
dj-database-url
psycopg2-binary
```

(plus any other packages you need)

### **3. In Railway: Create a New Project**

* **Choose ‚ÄúDeploy from GitHub Repo‚Äù** and select your repo with the Dockerfile.
* Railway will **detect your Dockerfile and build your image automatically**.

---

### **4. Set Railway Environment Variables**

* `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=surveyhub.settings.prod`
* `SECRET_KEY=...`
* `DATABASE_URL=...`
* Any other production env variables

> (Railway will auto-inject `DATABASE_URL` if you add the PostgreSQL plugin.)

---

### **5. Run Migrations**

* Go to Railway‚Äôs ‚ÄúShell‚Äù or ‚ÄúRun‚Äù feature and run:

  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate --settings=surveyhub.settings.prod
  ```

---

### **6. Visit Your Site!**

* Once deployed, your Django app will be live at your Railway-provided URL.

## **Bonus: Why Use a Dockerfile with Railway?**

* **No surprises**: The environment is exactly what you built locally.
* **Custom steps**: Collect static, run tests, build frontend, etc.
* **Flexibility**: Use system packages, custom scripts, etc.

---

## **Tips**

* **If you use static files, WhiteNoise, or media, test all in your Docker container locally first.**
* **If you need Celery or other background workers, you can run them as extra Railway services.**
