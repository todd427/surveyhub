* Started troubleshooting Gunicorn/Django/Docker errors, environment setup.
* Split drd.py (debug) vs prod.py (production) settings.
* Created/managed multiple .env files (.env.drd, .env.prod, etc.).

* Created shell helpers for environment management (prepDocker.sh).
* Debugged data fixtures and Postgres loaddata.

### **June 22, 2025**

* Advanced Docker Compose, YAML fixes, service health checks.
* Worked through Postgres “connection refused” errors.
* Validated web and db containers, checked environment variables inside Docker.
* Managed Python and Django settings environment in containers.
* Data migration, checked admin, loaddata to Postgres.
* Built up a migration checklist (in Markdown).

### **June 23, 2025**

* Verified Docker banner and production environment working.

### **How to Get Your Full Logs**

If you want the **actual, line-by-line message log**, you can:

* **Copy-paste this chat into a text file** (scroll to load all, then select/copy).
* Or: Let me know what format you want (Markdown, plain text, CSV) and if you want certain search terms, timestamps, or highlights, and I’ll generate it for you.

## **Let me know if you want the full (verbatim) export or more detail on any phase!**

I can generate a detailed log for a specific day, export it as a Markdown doc, or provide a filtered list (e.g., only errors, or only successful steps, etc). Just say the word!
