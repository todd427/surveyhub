**Yes, you’re absolutely right!**
To run your Django project in production (especially on Railway or most cloud platforms), you should use **PostgreSQL** instead of SQLite.
Here’s a step-by-step migration plan:

---

## 🟢 **1. Add PostgreSQL Support**

Install the driver:

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

Add to your `requirements.txt`:

```
psycopg2-binary
```

---

## 🟢 **2. Update `prod.py` for PostgreSQL**

If you’re following the split settings structure, in `prod.py`:

```python
from .base import *

import dj_database_url

DATABASES = {
    "default": dj_database_url.config(
        default=os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")
    )
}
```

And make sure you’ve got `dj-database-url` in your `requirements.txt` and installed:

```
dj-database-url
```

```bash
pip install dj-database-url
```

---

## 🟢 **3. Set up Your PostgreSQL Database**

* **On Railway:**

  * Add the **PostgreSQL plugin** to your Railway project.
  * Railway will give you a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (like: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`).

* **Locally for testing:**
  You can run PostgreSQL via Docker, Homebrew, or your system package manager.
  (But for most, you’ll do this on the cloud.)

---

## 🟢 **4. Set the DATABASE\_URL**

* **In Railway:**

  * Go to your project settings → Environment.
  * Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is present (Railway does this for you when you add Postgres).

---

## 🟢 **5. Run Migrations on PostgreSQL**

From your Railway deploy shell, or locally (pointed at the right database):

```bash
python manage.py migrate --settings=your_project.settings.prod
```

* If running locally, use:

  ```bash
  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=your_project.settings.prod python manage.py migrate
  ```

---

## 🟢 **6. (Optional) Transfer Your Old Data**

If you already have lots of survey data in SQLite and want it in Postgres:

* Use [django-dbbackup](https://github.com/jazzband/django-dbbackup), [pgloader](https://pgloader.io/), or export/import via fixtures:

  ```bash
  python manage.py dumpdata > data.json
  # switch settings to postgres
  python manage.py loaddata data.json
  ```

---

## 🟢 **7. Test Everything!**

* Make sure your app works, data saves, and surveys run on the new DB.

---

# 🏁 **Now You’re Production-Ready!**

If you want a `prod.py` and Railway env example with your **actual app/project names filled in**, let me know.
Ready to go?
**Next up:** Static files, secret keys, and all the production polish!
